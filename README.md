# climblog

Partially a Kaya climbing clone. Climb logging, data vis of climb data and general metrics about performance / consistency.

I was inspired by the Kaya climbing app, but when I climb I like to think through my performance on a climb and I think other people might enjoy that too.
I wanted a way to store and analyze this data without resorting to renting large containerized data storage and centrally authenticating users as well; it's a lot of security overhead that I've worked with before but somewhat want to avoid in the early stages. My north star is more centered around personal performance and easily owning and exporting your data if it's useful and interesting to you.

The application is currently in very early development. It does not currently have a release available to use, and is currently built through Expo Go.
