# climblog

## What is this?
Partially a Kaya climbing clone. Climb logging, data vis of climb data and general metrics about performance / consistency.

I was inspired by the Kaya climbing app, but when I climb I like to think through my performance on a climb and I think other people might enjoy that too.
The analytics that Kaya does are probably very good, but they're locked behind a paywall. I don't really want to know what kind of performance tracking they do, but I know what kind I want to do, and that relates to things like attempts on climbs per session, number of attempts per send of a particular style and difficulty combination, creating preference graphs for hold-type percentages, etc, so that's what's being focused on here.

I wanted a way to store and analyze this data without resorting to renting large containerized data storage and centrally authenticating users as well; it's a lot of security overhead that I've worked with before but somewhat want to avoid in the early stages. My north star is more centered around personal performance and easily owning and exporting your data if it's useful and interesting to you.

The application is currently in very early development. It does not currently have a release available to use, and is currently built through Expo Go.
