/**
 * TODO - write some tests for sqlite.ts
 * The reason I haven't gotten around to this is honestly laziness.
 * It's definitely possible and maybe trivial to stub out some test functions for 
 * sqlite.ts, but honestly I also just needed to play around with the
 * actual database and Expo module to wrap my head around the best way(s) to use it.
 *
 * Now that the behavior is relatively defined, it's easier to test the functions
 * in a way that aligns with conventional testing philosophy, and once I wrap my
 * head around that, to implement tests that guide me in writing additions to my
 * database APIs file.
